# CodeAlpha Internship Tasks – E‑Commerce & Social Media Platforms

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains two major projects developed during my internship at **CodeAlpha**:
1. **E‑Commerce Platform** – A web application for online shopping, product management, and secure transactions.
2. **Social Media Platform** – A web application enabling user interaction, posts, likes, comments, and community building.

Both projects were built to demonstrate full‑stack development skills, integrating **frontend, backend, and database systems** with modern tools and frameworks.
